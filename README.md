# FloydWarshall
Floyd-Warshall is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.
Algorithms and Data Structures lab work.

# Program description
There is a list of possible flights in a text file in format: DEPATRURE CITY; ARRIVAL CITY, DEPARTURE COST; ARRIVAL COST. If there is no direct or return flight, the price is indecated as N/A.
This programm reads data from that file (info.txt) and calculates the most cost efficiet way to get from one city to another.
